## Problem Description: 
---
Emotions are an essential part of our everyday life. Emotions have the ability to influence many of our decisions. How emotions vary in our daily chat conversations is an interesting problem. One approach can be to break chats into individual sentences and analyze emotional content. Also, an interesting adjacent application can be let's say how emotions vary in fictional Novels Stories. Here again, we can break down things into sentences as a valid approach. We will be looking to explore both these areas as a part of the project.

## Techniques being explored: 
---
We start with traditional non-neural network classifiers Naive Bayes, Logistic regression and SVM. Further, we explore how they compare with Recurrent neural networks and Long short-term memory networks(LSTMs).

## Dataset: 
---
The dataset is available here https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/ under the topic "Sentiment Analysis: Emotion in Text". The dataset is about 40000 in size and has 13 Labels.
